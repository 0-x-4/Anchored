# Anchored (mainly just the engine)

this is pretty much just an engine with a really simple game slapped on top. its not really even a game... just a tile editor where you can walk about and collision stuff happens. its got its own file format map content loading and everything.

Note: I did NOT create the Tiled map rendering part. It was taken from the Monogame.Extended.Tiled library!  

Interesting Parts:
 * Collider.cs
 * EntityWorld.cs
 * DebugConsole.cs
 * The whole UI Section
 * The whole save section
 * The whole map section
