# Anchored
this is the first edition of my game, though it's mainly an engine! I'm making this public since I can't find the time to work on this right now but it is one of my most proud achievements in computer science I think ever!  

Note: I did NOT create the Tiled map rendering part. It was taken from the Monogame.Extended.Tiled library!  

Interesting Parts:
 * Collider.cs
 * EntityWorld.cs
* DebugConsole.cs
 * The whole UI Section
 * The save section
